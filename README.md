# Chore Tracker
for ChabotHack2024

by Chong Su, Ronan Wong, Gideon Tong, and Matthew Denau

Our project idea is a task tracker app for chores that allows user to sync up shared chores with others in their household. 
It functions as a calendar that facilitates setting reminders and notes for specific dates.

Although we didn't finish the project, we currently have a command line interface that allows for the user to view and edit lists and items using the file system.
And a figma mockup of the app homepage.
